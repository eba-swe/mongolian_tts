## Training/Synthesizing Mongolian Text-To-Speech
11 hours of validated Mongolian speech database [Mongolian common voice corpus](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets).
1. Download the dataset from (https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets)
2. Pre-process the dataset with #TODO: Add corresponding command line command
